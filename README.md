### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Guan-Ting Su.<br>
I'm a graduate student at National Taiwan Normal University, studying Physics and Astronomy.<br>
Despite my major, I realized that front-end development is actually what I passionate about.<br>
Therefore, I started learning react-native since Oct, 2020.<br>
I'm also learning other web developing skills like html, css, react.
